            <h1>From Pages to Packages: How DEOVAL Printing
                Adapted During the Pandemic</h1>
            <p>During the pandemic, DEOVAL, a trusted name
                in printing services, faced significant challenges
                as the demand for traditional paper printing declined
                sharply. With businesses moving online, orders for
                flyers, brochures, and other printed materials greatly
                decreased. However, DEOVALâ€™s strength and flexibility
                stood out as they shifted their focus to creating custom
                packaging solutions. <br><br>

                The rise of food delivery and takeout services brought
                new opportunities, and DEOVAL started making packaging
                boxes for cakes and other food items. These helped businesses
                present their products in high-quality, attractive packaging.
                This smart change not only kept DEOVAL strong during tough times
                but also showed their dedication to meeting customer needs.
                Their story proves the importance of creativity and flexibility
                in overcoming challenges.</p>
